![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3886381/221078010-61bd0cc8-af27-473a-9e96-9199668cd9d7.png)


Hi Friends,

Microservices are a design pattern in which applications are composed of independent modules that communicate with each other within well defined boundaries. This makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy isolated parts of your application.

Welcome to "Microservices learning series" - the ultimate course for developers who want to learn how to build scalable, efficient, and robust Microservices using the .Net Core platform along with Docker, Kubernetes, Identity Server 4, Rabbit MQ, Angular 15, GRPC, Istio Service Mesh, SQL Server, MongoDB, PostGreSQL, Redis, Ocelot, Nginx, Azure, Helm Charts, and Auto Scale.

In this comprehensive course, you'll gain hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage your Microservices. You'll learn how to integrate Identity Server 4 for secure authentication and authorization, Rabbit MQ for messaging, and GRPC for efficient communication between Microservices.

You'll also learn how to use Istio Service Mesh to manage Microservices traffic, and how to configure and optimize SQL Server, MongoDB, PostGreSQL, and Redis for your Microservices. You'll use Ocelot and Nginx to manage your Microservices API gateway and deploy your Microservices to Azure using Helm Charts.

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to design, develop, and deploy Microservices using the latest industry-standard tools and practices, including auto-scaling.

Who Should Take This Course?

- Freshers who want to learn how to build scalable and efficient systems using Microservices architecture.

- Junior Developers who are looking to level up their skills and gain experience building real-world Microservices applications.

- Mid-Level Developers who want to learn how to build and deploy Microservices using the latest industry-standard tools and practices.

- Senior Developers who are looking to stay ahead of the curve and keep their skills up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.

- Software Architects who want to learn how to design and develop scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems using Microservices.

- Technical Leads who want to gain a deeper understanding of Microservices architecture and lead their teams in building scalable and efficient systems.

Every effort applied to make this project complete and accurate to the topic, but no warranty is implied. Any implementation in this project are MY OWN and also borrowed from best practices segment. ALL content presented AS-IS, for learning purposes only. Also this course will go  keep updated as and when new and stable framework gets released.

### Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. Once Docker for Desktop is installed, go to the **Settings > Advanced option**, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
* **Memory: 7 GB**
* CPU: 5
3. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```
